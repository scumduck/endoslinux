# EndeavourOS Custom Install Files

files include:
- user_packages.txt [^1]
- user_commands.bash [^2]
- user-commands-before.bash [^3]
     
      
> files are downloaded at the beginning of the install process while in the iso liveuser environment after booting the OS from a flashdrive.

Secure Boot must be disabled in order to boot iso from flash drive
I personally use Ventoy installed flashdrive with multiple versions of EndeavourOS depending on what Desktop Environment I wish to install, and whether or not I am doing an online or offline installation.
